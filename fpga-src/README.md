# Generic FPGA Code

This folder maintains generic FPGA code that should be portable across
FPGA frameworks (i.e., not necessarily tied to RFNoC). Of course, code
here may be tied to a specific platform (Xilinx or Altera).

The "common" subfolder maintains various FPGA source files required across
projects, while other projects maintain their own subfolders.

The "xilinx-ip" folder contains Xilinx-specific IP.
